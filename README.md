# Tuktuk Drive — Prototype

🚀 **Tuktuk Drive** is a bold, youth-driven web app that combines cloud storage and ride-hailing features — but with tuk-tuks as the main transportation mode, tailored for local cities like Mansoura and Cairo.

This is a single-page HTML prototype designed for offline testing and early feedback. It includes:
- 🔐 Simulated cloud storage (upload, folders, sharing)
- 🛺 Tuk-tuk booking flow (pickup, driver list, fare estimate)
- 🌙 Dark/light mode toggle
- 🌍 Arabic RTL support + English LTR toggle
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design
